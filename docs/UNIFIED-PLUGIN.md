# Unified plugin manifest

Issue #1412 extends the plugin taxonomy from `docs/PLUGIN-TAXONOMY.md` into one
manifest shape. The goal is one `plugin.json` that can declare every capability a
plugin contributes while preserving the current ServerPlugin, Installed/Wasm,
CanvasPlugin, and CLI plugin surfaces.

This started as a design-first slice: schema, migration map, reference manifest,
and validation tests. Alpha now includes the runtime loader bridge for plugin
API, proxy, menu, server, MCP tool, export, and CLI metadata surfaces.

## Manifest shape

```ts
type UnifiedPluginManifest = {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  entry: string;
  sdk?: string;
  tier?: 'core' | 'standard' | 'extra';
  enabled?: boolean;
  description?: string;

  mcpTools?: McpToolContribution[];
  apiRoutes?: ApiRouteContribution[];
  proxy?: ProxyContribution[];
  server?: ServerContribution;
  menu?: MenuContribution[];
  cliSubcommands?: CliSubcommandContribution[];

  // Back-compat aliases consumed by current loaders during migration.
  api?: { path: string; methods?: HttpMethod[] };
  lifecycle?: { start?: boolean; stop?: boolean };
  seedMenu?: boolean;
  cli?: { command: string; help: string };
};
```

The implemented TypeScript schema/normalizer lives in
`src/plugins/unified-manifest.ts`. A reference plugin manifest lives at
`docs/examples/unified-plugin/plugin.json`.

## Six capability surfaces

| Surface | Manifest key | Current owner | Unified migration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MCP tools | `mcpTools[]` | in-tree `src/tools/*` plus `src/index.ts` switch | Add dynamic MCP tool registry fed by normalized manifests. |
| API routes | `apiRoutes[]` | `ServerPlugin.api` + `routes()` | Normalize legacy `api` into `apiRoutes[]`; then mount via ServerPlugin bridge. |
| Proxy | `proxy[]` | gateway/vector-specific config | Add generic gateway entries from manifest path → target env. |
| Serve server | `server` | lifecycle/vector-server patterns | Spawn/health-check plugin-owned server from lifecycle manager. |
| URL/menu path | `menu[]` | menu DB/plugin metadata | Seed or expose menu contribution without treating it as renderer code. |
| CLI subcommand | `cliSubcommands[]` | `cli/src/plugins/*/plugin.json` | Normalize legacy `cli` into command entries and register with CLI loader. |


## Runtime loader

`src/plugins/unified-loader.ts` is the alpha runtime bridge. The HTTP server
loads normalized manifests at boot, then registers whichever surfaces are present:

- `apiRoutes[]` become Elysia routes that call the named handler from `entry`.
- `proxy[]` become best-effort Elysia proxy routes using `targetEnv`.
- `server` entries are autostarted unless `autostart: false`, get `PORT` /
  `ARRA_PLUGIN_PORT`, must pass `healthPath` (default `/health`), and are proxied
  behind `/api/plugins/<name>/server/*`.
- `menu[]` entries are seeded into `menu_items` as plugin-owned rows.
- `mcpTools[]` are advertised by `/api/mcp/tools`, appended to MCP stdio
  `tools/list`, and dispatched through `UnifiedRuntime.callMcpTool()`.
- `cliSubcommands[]` are collected as registry metadata for the CLI loader.

Missing surfaces are skipped. Invalid or failing plugin manifests are warned and
ignored so one plugin cannot prevent the server from booting.

## MCP tool runtime

Plugin MCP tools use the normalized manifest as their definition and the named
entry export as their handler:

```ts
type RegisteredMcpTool = {
  pluginName: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  inputSchema: Record<string, unknown>;
  group: string;              // e.g. "canvas" or "plugin:<name>"
  readOnly: boolean;
  enabled?: boolean;          // false = do not register or invoke
  enabledByDefault: boolean;
  call(args, ctx): Promise<ToolResponse>;
};
```

Runtime flow:

1. `loadUnifiedPlugins()` discovers and normalizes plugin manifests.
2. Tools with `enabled: false` are skipped before registration.
3. For each active `mcpTools[]` item, the runtime records public metadata and a
   `(plugin, handler)` invoker.
4. HTTP browsers see core + active plugin tools at `GET /api/mcp/tools`.
5. MCP stdio builds a fresh registry for each list/call, so plugin tools can be
   advertised, called, disabled, or removed without editing core tool code.
6. `runtime.reload()` re-scans plugin dirs in place; callers that hold the
   runtime object see added/removed MCP tools on the next list/call.

`runtime.reload()` mutates the existing `mcpTools` array, plugin registry, and
invoker map. API route additions still need the HTTP app to remount routes; use
reload for MCP tool in/out and restart/remount for newly added route surfaces.

`enabledByDefault: false` is softer than `enabled: false`: the tool remains
registered and callable when explicitly enabled by config, but it is not listed
by default. Use `enabled: false` to plug a tool out completely while keeping the
manifest entry documented.

### Toggle integration (#1372)

Static tool toggles remain backed by `TOOL_GROUPS`. Plugin tools are filtered at
manifest-load time by `enabled: false`, then at MCP registry time by their own
`enabledByDefault` flag and by explicit `disabled_tools` / `enabled_tools`
entries when the runtime tool name is present.
Future strict allow-list work can pass plugin names as an additional known-tool
set:

```ts
getDisabledTools(config, { extraToolNames: registry.toolNames() })
```

Resolution should stay the same:

1. disabled groups;
2. `disabled_tools` blocklist;
3. `enabled_tools` whitelist;
4. `allowed_tools` strict allow-list.

For groups, plugin tools can use their manifest `group` field. If no group is
provided, default to `plugin:<manifest.name>`. Existing config files keep working
because no static tool names change.

## Mapping existing plugin types

- **ServerPlugin** remains the runtime API/lifecycle adapter. Unified manifests
  normalize `api` → `apiRoutes[]` and `lifecycle`/`server` into a ServerPlugin
  bridge during migration.
- **InstalledPlugin/WasmPlugin** remains the local install/menu scanner. It can
  read unified `menu[]` later, but it should not execute renderer or MCP code.
- **CanvasPlugin** remains frontend bundled renderer code. Unified manifests may
  expose metadata/menu entries for canvas plugins, but must not imply dynamic
  unsigned React/Three execution.
- **CLI plugins** keep their current `cli` key until the CLI loader consumes
  `cliSubcommands[]` directly.

## Non-goals for this slice

- No restart/backoff supervisor changes for plugin-owned servers.
- No npm package extraction.
- No subdomain deploy work.
