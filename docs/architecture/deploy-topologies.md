# Deploy topologies for the modular backend (#2227)

Use this guide to choose how to deploy Arra Oracle after the backend is split
into clear layers: edge hosts, the `maw arra` backend plugin, a separate vector
server, and pluggable MCP tools.

## Quick decision table

| Topology | Components | Use when | Avoid when | Primary knobs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All-local | Studio dev server, `maw arra serve`, local DB, local or sidecar vector server, stdio MCP. | You need privacy, offline work, fast development, or a single-operator machine. | You need a public Studio/MCP URL or remote team access. | `maw arra serve`, `bun run vector:proxy`, `ORACLE_DATA_DIR`. |
| CF Workers edge + local backend | `workers/studio` static/API proxy, `workers/mcp`, optional `workers/federation`, local backend through a tunnel, vector sidecar near backend. | You want a public edge URL while keeping the brain/data on your machine or LAN. | You cannot keep a tunnel online or need all state to live at the edge. | `ORACLE_URL`, `ORACLE_MCP_URL`, `TUNNEL_URL`, `FEDERATION_TOKEN`. |
| Vercel frontend + backend URL | Vercel hosts `frontend/dist`; `api/proxy.ts` forwards `/api/*` to `ORACLE_URL`; backend/vector stay elsewhere. | Your team already uses Vercel and only needs Studio web hosting plus API proxying. | You need remote MCP on the same host or a private backend that Vercel cannot reach. | `vercel.json`, `ORACLE_URL`, Vercel env vars. |
| Federation tunnel | `workers/federation` signs and relays selected coordination routes to a cloudflared/local tunnel. | You need remote maw/session coordination without exposing the whole backend. | You need full Studio, full REST API, or vector traffic through the federation proxy. | `TUNNEL_URL`, `FEDERATION_TOKEN`, `/api/send`, `/api/sessions`. |

## Reference layer diagram

```text
public clients
  -> edge host (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, or none)
  -> maw arra backend plugin (REST, auth, tenants, plugin runtime)
  -> vector server sidecar (LanceDB, Qdrant, TurboVec, proxy protocol)
  -> MCP/plugin packages (core + community tools)
```

The edge host is replaceable. The backend plugin is the product brain. The
vector server owns heavy search/indexing. MCP tools remain installable plugin
surfaces, not hardcoded edge routes.

## Topology details

### 1. All-local

All-local is the safest default for development and personal memory work.
Everything runs on one workstation or LAN host.

```bash
maw arra serve --port 47778
bun run vector:proxy              # optional separate vector sidecar
cd frontend && bun run dev        # optional Studio during development
```

Use this when:

- data should not leave the machine;
- the operator uses Claude Desktop or another local MCP client;
- you are testing plugin install/reload behavior;
- vector indexing needs local disk/GPU access.

Operational notes:

- Keep `ORACLE_DATA_DIR` on durable storage.
- Use stdio MCP or local HTTP (`http://127.0.0.1:47778`) for clients.
- If you split vector search out, point the backend at the sidecar with
  `ORACLE_PROXY_VECTOR_URL` or the durable vector proxy config.

### 2. CF Workers edge + local backend

This topology puts only the public shell at Cloudflare. Workers serve Studio,
remote MCP, or federation proxy routes, then forward to the backend over a public
backend URL or a tunnel.

```bash
maw arra serve --port 47778
bun run vector:proxy
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:47778
```

Use this when:

- users need a stable public Studio URL;
- Claude/agents need remote MCP over HTTPS;
- data and vector files must remain local or on a private VM;
- edge cache/auth is useful, but Workers should stay thin.

Operational notes:

- `workers/studio` uses `ORACLE_URL` and `ORACLE_MCP_URL`.
- `workers/mcp` proxies tools to the backend and can use tenant registry data.
- `workers/federation` uses `TUNNEL_URL` and `FEDERATION_TOKEN` for selected maw
  coordination routes.
- Do not move native vector libraries or SQLite/LanceDB files into Workers.

### 3. Vercel frontend + backend URL

Vercel is the simplest web-UI option for teams already using Vercel. It hosts the
Vite build and proxies browser `/api/*` calls to the backend.

```bash
# Vercel build path
cd frontend && bun run build

# Backend remains separate
maw arra serve --port 47778
```

Use this when:

- the priority is one-click Studio hosting;
- the backend already has a reachable HTTPS origin;
- Vercel preview deployments are part of the team workflow.

Operational notes:

- `vercel.json` sets `buildCommand` and `outputDirectory` for `frontend/dist`.
- `api/proxy.ts` forwards `/api/*` to `ORACLE_URL`.
- Remote MCP should still use the Cloudflare MCP worker or another MCP-specific
  host until Vercel has a dedicated MCP route.

### 4. Federation tunnel

The federation proxy is not a full backend deploy. It is a narrow remote-control
path for maw/session coordination through a signed tunnel.

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:47778
# Worker env: TUNNEL_URL=https://<tunnel>.trycloudflare.com
# Worker secret: FEDERATION_TOKEN=<shared secret>
```

Use this when:

- remote agents need to send maw messages or inspect local session state;
- you want HMAC-signed relay paths without exposing all `/api/*` routes;
- the main Studio/API surface stays local or behind another edge.

Operational notes:

- Current relay routes are `/api/send`, `/api/sessions`, and
  `/api/federation/status`.
- Requests are signed with `FEDERATION_TOKEN` and forwarded to `TUNNEL_URL`.
- Keep this topology scoped; add explicit relay routes rather than opening a
  catch-all proxy.

## Choosing a topology

- Pick **all-local** first for development, private memory, and plugin authoring.
- Pick **CF Workers edge + local backend** when you need public HTTPS for Studio
  or MCP but want storage/vector work near the operator.
- Pick **Vercel** when the web UI is the only public surface and the backend is
  already reachable.
- Pick **federation tunnel** for narrow remote coordination between agents and a
  local operator machine.

## Promotion path

1. Start all-local until `/api/health`, MCP tools, and vector search are green.
2. Split vector into `bun run vector:proxy` when indexing becomes heavy or needs
   a separate host.
3. Add Vercel or Cloudflare Workers for public Studio access.
4. Add the Cloudflare MCP worker for remote MCP clients.
5. Add federation tunnel only for signed coordination routes.

Each step should preserve the same backend contracts: authenticated HTTP to the
backend, explicit tenant headers, `/vectors/*` for vector sidecars, and plugin
surfaces loaded through unified-loader.
