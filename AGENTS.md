# AGENTS.md — arra-oracle-v3 Operating Contract

Top-level contract for **every** agent working in this repo (codex/omx coders,
Claude leads, human contributors). omx auto-generates a session-local AGENTS.md
for its own runtime; **this** file is the project-level source of truth and
overrides anything that conflicts. Mirrors `CLAUDE.md` Project Conventions.

> arra-oracle-v3 is the **MCP memory / search layer** for the Oracle family:
> semantic search over 20k+ docs (bge-m3 + nomic + qwen3 + FTS5), the indexer
> pipeline, federation plumbing, and the `muninn_search` MCP surface.

## 1. Team Model

- **Lead** (`claude`): architecture, reference modules, contract/boundary
  decisions, review-before-merge. Reasoning-heavy work stays here.
- **Coders** (`codex-N`, engine `omx`): mechanical fan-out once a reference
  module + pattern exist. One coder = one route cluster / module.
- **Pattern — Reference-First Fan-Out:** the lead ships ONE reference module
  first; coders copy that shape. No reference → codex drift → inconsistent work.
- Engine map lives in `.maw/maw.config.80.json` (`claude48` lead, `omx` coders,
  `sonnet` digger). Worktrees: `agents/1-codex-N/` (git worktrees, gitignored).

## 2. Branch Rules — push to `alpha`, never `main`

- **`alpha` is the working trunk.** All feature/fix work targets `alpha`.
- **`main` → STABLE release** (`calver-release.yml` tags `vX.Y.Z` marked latest).
  ⚠️ NEVER push or merge to `main` without explicit user direction in-session.
  A repo-local hook (`.claude/hooks/block-push-main.sh`) blocks pushes to main.
- **`alpha` → PRE-RELEASE** (`vX.Y.Z-alpha.N`, prerelease, not latest). This is
  the default. RELEASE POLICY: **always alpha.**
- Coders work in their existing worktree; **merge `origin/main`/`origin/alpha`
  before starting** so you branch from current trunk.

## 3. No Force Ops (safety)

- **Never** `git push --force` / `-f`, `git checkout -f`, `git clean -f`,
  `rm -rf`. Resolve conflicts with a normal merge.
- **Never** merge a PR without explicit user approval (`gh pr merge` is gated).
- Destructive/outward actions (push, PR, deploy) are confirm-first.

## 4. Issue → PR Flow

1. Branch from current `alpha`.
2. Implement; keep commits descriptive (`feat:`/`fix:`/`chore:` …).
3. **Build gate must pass** (§6) before push.
4. `git push -u origin <branch>` → `gh pr create` targeting **`alpha`**.
5. Report (§7). Wait for review. Do not self-merge.

## 5. File Layout & Size

- **≤ 250 lines per file** (source, tests, docs). Over → split by concern,
  don't pad with helpers.
- **Tests: nested, one behavior per file**, mirroring the route tree:
  `tests/http/<cluster>/<endpoint>.test.ts`. HTTP contract tests are
  fetch-based against a spawned server (works for Hono now, Elysia after migration).
- **Web framework migration Hono → Elysia:** new Elysia sub-apps in
  `src/routes-elysia/`, legacy Hono in `src/routes/`. Swap `src/server.ts` once
  all modules land. maw-js is the reference implementation.

## 6. Build Gate

- Runtime: **Bun ≥ 1.2** — `bun test`, `bun run`, `bunx --bun`. No Node-only APIs.
- Type-check is the build: `tsc --noEmit` must pass (github-only repo, no binary).
- `bun test` (or the scoped cluster, e.g. `bun test tests/http/forum/`) green
  before any push.

## 7. Reporting (codex → lead)

Report **only on completion** with: ✅ summary · commit SHA · build/test result ·
PR URL. If blocked, report the blocker and the alternative you tried. Don't
narrate every step; don't ask "should I proceed?" on obvious next steps.

## 8. Data / Schema

- Schema changes go through **Drizzle** (`src/db/schema.ts`) + `bun db:push`.
  Never inline `CREATE TABLE` / `ALTER TABLE` / raw `CREATE INDEX` in code.
  Back up before migrations (db:push index `IF NOT EXISTS` caveat).

## 9. Tech Stack (quick map)

- `src/vector/`, `src/indexer/` — embeddings (batch via Ollama) + indexing
- `src/tools/` — MCP tools (`muninn_search`)
- `src/gateway/`, `src/peer/` — federation
- `src/vault/`, `src/trace/`, `src/learn/` — knowledge management
- `src/routes/` (Hono) → `src/routes-elysia/` (Elysia, in migration)
- HTTP backend on `:47778`; frontend (Vite) on `:3000` proxying `/api/*`

touch `main`.
